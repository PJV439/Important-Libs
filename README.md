1. SurveyKit
-[x] This is a library for creating beautiful surveys on Android.
-[x] It was inspired by ResearchKit Surveys on iOS and allows you to create many types of surveys. You can check them in the really good comprehensive documentation with examples.
-[x] The project is covered with tests (which is not so common) and released under an MIT license.

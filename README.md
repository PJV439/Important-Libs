this is my first contribution to open source!
if anyone wants to start please do it 
i am looking for some new libraries that might help some one

1. TimeRangePicker

Here’s a customisable, easy-to-use, and functional circular time range picker library:
The project is 100% written in Kotlin and was created to mimic Apple’s iOS or Samsung’s bedtime picker. It has good documentation, which also helps with the first configuration.
The library is copyrighted under an MIT license.

2. RoundedProgressBar

Here’s another interesting library for creating elegantly rounded ProgressBars.
It allows us to create progress bars with animations and text customizations. The documentation is quite comprehensive, there is even a sample in Google Play.
The project has version 2.1.0 and is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
